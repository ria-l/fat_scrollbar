v 1.1

- allow picking a custom color (for all pages)

### design:

- click icon to access popup.
- popup has a text field that takes a hex code (accepts both with and without hash)
- click ok to update the color

the current design just applies the css to any page that loads without worrying about anything else.

to have custom, i think i ahve to inject the css into every page. i could pull the color preference out of chrome extension storage.

v 1.0

- force scrollbar on all pages in one color :)
